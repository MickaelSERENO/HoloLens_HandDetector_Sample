This project shows how to use the HoloLens_HandDetector C++ library by displaying a small cube where the first hand is detected.

C++ library : https://github.com/MickaelSERENO/HoloLens_HandDetector

Once the Visual Studio build is created, you have to manually modify the appxmanifest to add the following capabilities:
<rescap:Capability Name="perceptionSensorsExperimental" />
with rescap declared as xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"
